      <section class="about-header">
        <p>Thank you for visiting :) My name is Anna Nguyen, and I'm
          a second-year undergrad at Cornell University studying computer
          science and information science in the UX/UI track. Originally a CS major,
          I stumbled into design after taking an Intro to Product Design class and
          fell in love with how versatile it could be. I found that I loved
          <span id="highlight-p-text">connecting with people and communities and
            hearing all their different stories</span>, which inspires me to <span id="highlight-p-text">
            better inform my own decisions as a developer and designer and to
            grow my perspective about things around me</span>.
          Using the skills I have, I hope to support underserved communties and
          to continuously listen, understand, and sympathize.
        </p>
        <p>Some fun facts about me: I love skincare & fashion. I make beaded flower
          rings in my free time (hit me up if you want one!!). And my
          great-grandma was supposedly a part of Vietnamese royalty.
